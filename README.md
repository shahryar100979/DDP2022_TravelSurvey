# 2022 Annual Commuting Survey Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and findings of the 2022 Annual Commuting Survey conducted by the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP). The goal of this survey was to understand the commuting patterns and preferences of employees in downtown Denver, with an emphasis on sustainable transportation options.

## Contents
- `survey_data.csv`: Raw data from the survey.
- `data_processing.py`: Script for data cleaning and transformation.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Script for feature engineering.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `report_v2.pdf`: Detailed report of the survey findings and analysis.

## Survey Highlights
- 3668 total responses, with a 85.4% completion rate.
- Demographic and behavioral data collected on commuting behaviors.
- Focus on sustainable transportation options and employer-provided programs.

## Analysis and Results
- **Data Processing & Cleaning**: Transformation of raw data for analysis, including error correction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of informative and independent variables to enhance machine learning model performance.
- **Modal Shares**: Analysis of the various modes of transportation used for commuting.
- **Employer Provided Transportation Programs**: Examination of the impact of different transportation programs on commuting choices.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman correlation and chi-square tests to understand the relationships between different factors and commuting choices.

## Key Findings
- Significant factors influencing commuting choices include gender, access to secure bike parking, and employer-provided transportation programs.
- Notable correlations between demographic factors and preferences for different modes of transportation.
